THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to,"" Davis declaimed. 
""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

The Real Wolf

RECKONINGS
By PAUL KRUGMAN



ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me
for my ""Naderite"" columns on the California energy crisis. He just
didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could
possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the
sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy
capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high
apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that
sensible people have learned to discount such claims.

 But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is
doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will
believe it.

 True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages
even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable
competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that
market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring
billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the
generators.

 But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable
competition in California's power market, and that the actions of
generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis.
The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of
more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale
prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has
kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably -
short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought
to be lots of excess capacity.

 As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the
state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is
a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly
whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for
other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And
such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced
outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" - a
view shared by a growing number of other researchers.

 Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently
decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in
place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently""
because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to
be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1
vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been
sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the
grounds that it would be ineffectual.

 What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in
emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices
have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no
emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity
market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that
it is not.

 Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes,
offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt
laundering"" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one
reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for
example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring
states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds
that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at
the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive
to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we
never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they
will be pretty inefficient.""

 The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan.
There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -
indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well
received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.

 The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it,
that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf
is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action
was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls
the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .
. a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to
deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster.

 Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the
administration have yet to offer California any significant
relief.
