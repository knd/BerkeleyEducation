Understanding of the specifications was the first step and didn’t take long. Installing Tampermonkey is relatively straightforward because of the ease of Chrome extension with one-click setup. The development bottleneck fell into the reading tutorials and APIs on d3.js. The specification of Tampermonkey was neat and easy to get. D3.js APIs and SVG are more complicated to read on. Extracting links took hours to debug by using d3 selections.

We can reduce the development time by having better documentations on d3. It’s an excellent tool for drawing on HTML page. However, jQuery seems for intuitive for selections and has more documentations and examples online. d3.js community is quite small. Modularity is the key to development. Figuring out how to solve each part and refactoring code later to organize is important. Print out with console.log is another tool to debug.
